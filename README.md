LoanEase:

Project Title & Description:
Title:LoanEase Simplifying Access to Digital Microloans

Description:
LoanEase is a full-stack financial web app that allows users to apply for small loans, track repayments, and build credit profiles over time. Admins can view, approve, and manage loan applications. The system includes loan calculators, user authentication, automated credit scoring, and repayment history.

Tech Stack
Frontend:
React.js (Component-based architecture)

Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling)

React Router (Routing)

Axios (API calls)

PWA Support for mobile-friendly behavior

Backend:

Node.js + Express.js (REST API)

MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose

JWT for secure authentication

bcrypt.js for password hashing

 Tooling:
Cursor (AI-enhanced IDE for coding, refactoring, and debugging)

Postman (API testing)

GitHub + GitHub Actions (Version control & CI/CD)

Render / Railway (App deployment)

Key Features

User Registration & Login

Loan Application Form

Loan Calculator (based on interest rate & term)

Repayment Schedule & History

Admin Panel (View/Approve/Reject loans)

In-App Notifications (e.g., repayment reminders)

Credit Scoring Logic (based on user history)

AI Integration Strategy
1. Code or Feature Generation (via Cursor)

Using Cursor, you ll generate:

React components (LoanForm, Dashboard, History)

Express routes (/apply, /repay, /loans)

Mongoose models (User, Loan, Repayment)

Middleware (auth, validation)


Prompt  Example in Cursor:

1.Create a Mongoose model for a loan with user ID, amount, interest rate, term, and repayment status.

2. Testing Support (in Cursor)

Generate test files using Jest and Supertest for:

Auth routes

Loan creation and update

Eligibility logic


Prompt Example in Cursor:

"Generate a Jest test for an Express route that accepts a loan application and returns a success or failure response."

 3. Schema-Aware/API-Aware Generation

Feed Cursor your Mongoose schema and generate:

Complete CRUD APIs

Data validation logic

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation scaffolding

Prompt Example in Cursor:
"Based on this schema, create an Express controller with functions to apply for a loan, fetch all loans by user, and update repayment status."


In-Editor AI Tooling: Cursor

Why Cursor?

Inline autocomplete and real-time code generation

Seamless refactoring and bug fixing

Natural language to code conversion/explain,/test,/fix, and /refactor commands


PR Review Workflow:

Auto-generate commit messages:

"Summarize this commit and generate a clean, conventional commit message."

Review code for edge cases or anti-patterns:

"Review this function and suggest security improvements."

 Prompting Strategy (Examples You'll Use in Cursor)

1. Generate a React component called LoanCalculator that takes in amount, interest rate, and duration, and displays monthly repayment.


2. Create a protected Express route to apply for a loan. Authenticate user, validate inputs, and store in MongoDB.

3. Write a Jest test to verify that a loan repayment route correctly deducts the amount from outstanding balance.
